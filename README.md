> A complete racing intelligence platform combining tactical driver coaching with strategic race planning for the Toyota GR Cup "Hack the Track" hackathon.

## Overview

RaceIQ Pro is an AI-powered racing analytics platform that transforms raw telemetry and timing data into actionable insights for drivers and teams. By combining machine learning, statistical analysis, and optimization algorithms, it provides both real-time tactical coaching and long-term strategic planning capabilities.

## Key Features

### 1. Tactical Analysis Module

- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based identification of performance outliers using Isolation Forest
- **Driver Coaching**: Automated feedback on braking points, corner entry/exit, and consistency
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmark against fastest laps and optimal theoretical times
- **Real-time Insights**: Identify areas for immediate improvement

### 2. Strategic Analysis Module
- **Tire Degradation Modeling**: Predictive models for tire performance over race distance
- **Pit Strategy Optimization**: Monte Carlo simulation for optimal pit timing
- **Position Impact Analysis**: Quantify the value of track position and overtaking opportunities
- **Fuel Strategy**: Optimize fuel load vs. performance trade-offs
- **Race Simulation**: What-if analysis for different race scenarios

### 3. Integration Engine
- **Cross-Module Intelligence**: Connect tactical insights with strategic recommendations
- **Unified Dashboard**: Single interface for all analytics
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated ETL from raw telemetry to actionable insights
- **Export Capabilities**: Reports and visualizations for team review

## Advanced Features

### SHAP Explainability
Understand **WHY** anomalies were detected with feature importance analysis powered by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Get detailed breakdowns showing which telemetry factors (speed, braking, throttle, etc.) contributed most to performance issues.

**Benefits:**
- Transparent AI decisions - see exactly what triggered each anomaly
- Feature importance rankings - know which factors matter most
- Actionable insights - focus on the right improvements

### Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification
Get confidence intervals on strategic recommendations: "90% confident: pit window laps 13-17"

**Benefits:**
- Statistical rigor - know how certain your strategy recommendations are
- Risk assessment - understand the uncertainty in predictions
- Multiple confidence levels - view 80%, 90%, and 95% intervals
- Probabilistic forecasting - see the full distribution, not just point estimates

### Weather Integration
Real-time track condition adjustments for tire degradation and lap times based on temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation.

**Benefits:**
- Hot track (>40°C): +10-20% tire degradation - adjust pit strategy earlier
- Cold track (<25°C): -5-10% degradation - extend stint lengths
- Rain conditions: +10% lap times - recalculate race pace
- Weather-aware recommendations - factor real-world conditions into every decision

### Interactive Track Map Visualization
Stunning visual overlays showing performance heatmaps on actual track layouts.

**Benefits:**
- Color-coded sections (red=slow, green=fast) - instantly see problem areas
- Interactive maps - click sections for detailed breakdowns
- Driver comparisons - overlay multiple drivers on the same map
- Track layouts for Barber, COTA, Sonoma, and more
